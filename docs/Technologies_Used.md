# Technologies Used in eShopOnWeb_VB.NET

This document outlines the technologies, languages, and frameworks utilized in the eShopOnWeb_VB.NET project, along with the rationale behind their selection.

## Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET)

VB.NET is the primary programming language used for server-side code in the eShopOnWeb_VB.NET project. It is a modern, object-oriented language that provides a productive environment for developers familiar with the Visual Basic language.

**Rationale**: VB.NET was chosen for its readability, ease of use, and strong typing, which helps prevent common programming errors. It is well-supported by Microsoft and integrates seamlessly with the .NET ecosystem, making it a reliable choice for enterprise applications.

## ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is the web framework used to build the eShopOnWeb_VB.NET application. It is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.

**Rationale**: The choice of ASP.NET Core is due to its modularity, lightweight nature, and ability to host on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It also offers built-in support for dependency injection and a robust set of tools for web development.

## Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework used for data access in the project. It enables developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data-access code.

**Rationale**: Entity Framework Core was selected for its ability to reduce boilerplate code, its support for LINQ queries, and its database provider agnosticism, which allows for flexibility in choosing or switching database engines.

## SignalR

SignalR is a library that enables real-time web functionality, such as live chat and real-time notifications, by allowing server-side code to send asynchronous notifications to client-side web applications.

**Rationale**: SignalR was incorporated to provide a seamless real-time user experience, which is essential for features like live updates of product availability or chat support in an e-commerce platform.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a front-end framework used for developing responsive and mobile-first web pages. It provides a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for creating modern user interfaces.

**Rationale**: Bootstrap was chosen for its extensive component library, responsive grid system, and ease of customization, which accelerates the development of a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

## jQuery

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation.

**Rationale**: jQuery is used in the project for its simplicity and ease of use, which allows for writing less code to accomplish more. Its wide adoption and extensive plugin ecosystem make it a practical choice for interactive web applications.

## jQuery Validate

jQuery Validate is a plugin for the jQuery library that provides client-side form validation. It is used to ensure that user inputs are correct before they are submitted to the server.

**Rationale**: The inclusion of jQuery Validate is to enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback on input errors, reducing the number of server-side validations needed and improving form submission success rates.

## jQuery Validation Unobtrusive

jQuery Validation Unobtrusive is a library that integrates jQuery Validate with ASP.NET's unobtrusive validation system, allowing for cleaner separation of validation logic from HTML markup.

**Rationale**: This library was selected to maintain the unobtrusive JavaScript principle, keeping the HTML clean and enhancing maintainability by separating the validation rules from the HTML elements.

## toastr

toastr is a JavaScript library for non-blocking notifications, which can be used to display alerts, information, errors, or warnings.

**Rationale**: toastr was integrated into the project to provide a user-friendly way to display notifications without interrupting the user's workflow, thereby improving the overall user experience.

In conclusion, the technologies used in eShopOnWeb_VB.NET were chosen for their ability to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly e-commerce platform. They represent a blend of performance, productivity, and community support, ensuring that the project remains maintainable and up-to-date with modern web development practices.
