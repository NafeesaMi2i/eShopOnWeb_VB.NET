# eShopOnWeb_VB.NET Architecture

eShopOnWeb_VB.NET is architected as a multi-layered web application that follows industry-standard design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. The architecture is designed to facilitate the flow of data from the user interface to the database and back, while providing a clear separation between different concerns of the application.

## Main Components

The system is composed of several key components:

- **Web Front-End**: This is the entry point for users interacting with the eShopOnWeb_VB.NET application. It is responsible for presenting information to the user and handling user input.

- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: This layer contains the core functionality of the application, including domain models, services, and business rules. It processes user inputs received from the front-end and applies business logic to it.

- **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: The DAL is responsible for communicating with the database. It uses models from the BLL to retrieve and store data.

- **Database**: The persistent storage mechanism for the application. It stores all the data required by the application, such as product information, customer data, and order details.

## Structure and Data Flow

The project is structured into modules and classes that correspond to the different components of the system. Each module/class has a specific responsibility, and together they form the complete application.

The data flow in eShopOnWeb_VB.NET typically follows this path:

1. A user interacts with the web front-end, performing actions such as browsing products or placing an order.
2. The front-end captures the user's input and sends it to the BLL.
3. The BLL processes the input, applying business rules and logic, and then interacts with the DAL.
4. The DAL performs the necessary operations on the database, such as querying for data or persisting changes.
5. The results from the DAL are sent back to the BLL, which may perform additional processing.
6. The BLL sends the processed data back to the front-end to be displayed to the user.

## Component Interactions

- The **Web Front-End** communicates with the **BLL** through controllers and view models. The controllers receive user input, invoke services in the BLL, and return views populated with data.

- The **BLL** interacts with the **DAL** using repository interfaces, which abstract the details of data access. This allows for loose coupling and easier testing.

- The **DAL** uses Entity Framework or another ORM to interact with the **Database**, mapping domain models to database tables and vice versa.

## Design Patterns and Architectural Styles

The eShopOnWeb_VB.NET project employs several design patterns and architectural styles:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: This pattern separates the application into three main components, allowing for independent development, testing, and maintenance of each component.

- **Repository Pattern**: Used in the DAL to provide an abstraction layer over the data access logic, improving code maintainability and enabling easier testing.

- **Dependency Injection**: This technique is used throughout the application to manage dependencies between classes, enhancing modularity and testability.

In conclusion, the architecture of eShopOnWeb_VB.NET is designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to maintain, with clear separation between the different layers of the application and adherence to best practices in software design.
